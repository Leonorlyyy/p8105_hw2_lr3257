# Homework 2

## Problem 1

``` r
### read data file
NYC_df = 
  read_csv("data/NYCsubway.csv",  na = c("NA", "", "."), show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)
    )
```

### Description:

There are 32 variables contained in this dataset: division (character),
line (character), station_name (character), station_latitude (double),
station_longtitude (double), route 1-7 (character), route 8-11 (double),
entrance_type (character), entry (character), exit_only (character),
vending (character), staffing (character), staff_hours (character), ada
(logical), ada_notes (character), free_crossover (logical),
north_south_street (character), east_west_street (character), corner
(character), entrance_latitude (double), entrance_longitude (double),
station_location (character), entrance_location (character).

So far, I have used the janitor::clean_names() function for some basic
cleanings about the column names, including converting all column names
to lowercase, replace spaces and special characters with underscores,
etc. I have also defined the “NA”, “,”, and “.” values in the dataset to
be na for the convenience of later data analysis.

The dimension of the dataset now is 1868 rows x 32 columns. Despite I
have changed the entry variable from character to logical type, the
dataset is still not tidy, as there are many more character variables
that could be turned into logical variables, and there are many NA data
in it that may interfere further data analysis.
